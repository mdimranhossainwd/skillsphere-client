# 📚 Skill Sphere

Skill Sphere is a full-featured online learning platform inspired by Udemy and Coursera. It provides students with access to skill-based courses, instructors with a dashboard to manage their content, and admins with full control over user and course data. This platform is built using the MERN stack with role-based dashboards and Stripe payment integration.
